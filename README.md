# Contributing

To add anything, please open an issue or pull request.

Rules: 
* Within a section, projects are ordered alphabetically.
* Anything you add must have an existing public website, repository and/or docs. The page should be descriptive enough that it is possible to understand what the project is about, and the project should have more substance than just an announcement.
* The project should be strongly relevant to Decentralized AI.
* No waitlist-only products.
* No shilling tokens.

We (maintainers of this repo) will use our best judgement to add only the things we believe are valuable for the community.
